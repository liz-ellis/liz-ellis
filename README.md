## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Liz! With 15 years of experience in the hospitality industry, Iâ€™m passionate about improving user experiences and learning new tech. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on mastering React, JavaScript, and back-end development to combine my love for hospitality and tech. Iâ€™m building a habit-tracking web app to track daily goals and milestones, integrating back-end functionality to gain hands-on experience.

Iâ€™m diving into advanced React concepts and refining my JavaScript skills to build dynamic, efficient applications. Ultimately, I aim to bring my skills into the hospitality tech industry and create innovative solutions. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect for collaboration or feedback!
